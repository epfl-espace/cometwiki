# Work with us

As part of our effort to make our resources available to a broader community, our [CDF](/glossary#c) is open to anyone internal or external to EPFL. 

If you are an EPFL lab, an academic institution, or a company planning to conduct a concurrent engineering session or a full study and you are interested in having access to our facility and the support of our staff, or you would like to learn more about how to conduct your own concurrent design studies, you can now get in contact with us by filling up **[this form](https://espace.epfl.ch/contact-us/)** or by sending an email to **[contact@spacecdf.ch](mailto:contact@spacecdf.ch)**.
