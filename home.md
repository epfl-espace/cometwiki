# eSpace Concurrent Engineering ![cdf_logo.png](/cdf_logo.png =180x){.align-right}
Welcome to the the Concurrent Engineering wiki created and maintained by the **[EPFL Space Center (eSpace)](https://espace.epfl.ch/)**.

![espace-logo-arial-black.png](/espace-logo-arial-black.png =200x){.align-center}

For any issues or questions about this wiki, contact David RodrÃ­guez at [david.rodriguez@epfl.ch](mailto:david.rodriguez@epfl.ch). 

## What is it?
This wiki was built to gather all relevant information about our concurrent engineering activities. 

If you are completely new to concurrent engineering, here you will find all the information you need to learn about **[what concurrent engineering is](/concurrent_engineering#definition)** and how to **[plan and conduct a concurrent design session](/concurrent_engineering#ce_workflow)**. 

For a list of terms and acronyms often used, check the **[Glossary](/glossary)** section.

For those already familiar with concurrent engineering, this wiki contains information on **[previous design studies](/ce_studies)** conducted at our center as well as a precise description of **[our facility](/cdf)** and **[approach to concurrent design](/concurrent_engineering#ce_workflow)**.

Be aware that some parts of the wiki might be restricted and only accessible by eSpace members.

> **If you are part of the eSpace team** and new to this wiki, you need an account to log in and have full access to content of the wiki. Contact [David](mailto:david.rodriguez@epfl.ch) and your account will be set up right away.

> **If you are not part of the eSpace team** and you are interested in conducting a concurrent design session with us, feel free to explore the wiki and reach out to us via the **[Work With Us](/work_with_us)** section.

## For staff members

Once your account has been set up, you will have access to all the resources in the 'Staff Area' section of the wiki, at the bottom of the left navigation panel. Here you will find **[tips and lessons learned](/useful_tips)**, a **[bibliography](/bibliography)** of useful books and papers on the topic, a **[SW index](/sw_index)**, and a **[report template](/study_report_template)** to be used when setting up a new concurrent engineering study.
