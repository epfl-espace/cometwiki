# Our Concurrent Design Facility

This page contains a description of our [CDF](/glossary#c) and how to set it up when new sessions are planned. Since the infrastructure is not currently permanent, make sure to follow and complete the checklists for material and equipment provided at the end of this page. 

### Our logo
The current logo for our [CDF](/glossary#c) was designed by [Thomas Delacretaz](http://thomasdelacretaz.ch/).

## eSpace CDF description

### Layout {#layout}

Adapted from the design of ESA/ESTEC's [CDF](/glossary#c) and built with the support of ESA's Systems and Concurrent Engineering Section, eSpace CDF has a much smaller configuration, as shown in the figure below, and focuses on the core subsystems of a space mission. The current setup has been tailored to be used for [ESA's concurrent engineering challenge](/dumbo). The layout can be altered and adapted based on the requirements of a given study. Subsystem stations can be added or removed depending on the customers' needs and the mission/system requirements. The final room layout shall be prepared by the study coordinator and/or the systems engineer/facilitator before the start of a new [CE](/glossary#c) [session](/glossary#s).

### Connecting remotely {#connecting_remotely}
While concurrent engineering benefits for the colocation of multiple teams with varying expertise under the same roof, some of the subsystems or stations can be connected remotely. Compared to the distribution of stations in the ESA/ESTEC facility ([see here](/concurrent_engineering)), our current layout does not include a station for the customer, who in the case of the concurrent engineering challenge were connected via WebEx displayed on the main screen. 

For remote teams, WebEx, Zoom, Skype or any other video conferencing platform can be used, ideally combined with an online messaging platform like WebEx Teams or Slack. 

### A few tips about the layout of a CDF:
- The **large screen (TV) and the white board** at the front are extremely important and shall allow participants to interact and discuss in small groups or in front of everyone when needed. They can support **brainstorming and ideation**, which are really useful processes at the beginning of a session.
- The **tables** are placed this way so everyone can see each other. This facilitates communication. It is also better if the **videoconferencing infrastructure** is a the front, so all subsystems can interact with other teams or experts joining remotely.
- The subsytems are spread so teams that have to **interact extensively together** are close to one another. Like propulsion and trajectory analysis, or power and thermal subsytems. But, of course, nothing shall prevent participants to move and talk to others across the facility if needed.
- The systems engineer(s) and session facilitators can also have desks to work on their computers but they shall be around the center of the room to constantly **stay in contact and coordinate** the participants. They have a role of support in every tasks: design, budgets, requirements, but also in communication and coordination of the process.
- The **customers** shall also have a central position in the layout as they are the ones who can clarify requirements or validate design choices during the process. They shall be in contact with the systems engineers which have the task to translate their needs into technical requirements for each subsystem.

## Material and equipment checklist

As mentioned, the CDF infrastructure is not permanent at eSpace. The room currently used is regularly kept in its meeting room configuration. Although most of the material and equipment needed to turn the room into its CDF configuration is already present in the room, some things may need to be rented or transfered from other rooms prior to the start of a new study. 

> Make sure to review the **[preparation checklist](#preparation_checklist)** section to learn how to properly setup the CDF. 
{.is-warning}

The material and equipment required for a new [CE](/glossary#c) study includes:
- Tables and chairs (as per needed based on the number of subsystems/stations and people per subsystem/station).
- Power strips to provide outlets to power the work stations.
- Videoconferencing equipment (when joined by remote teams), including:
	- One or multiple speakers.
  - A central microphone and/or individual headsets for each of the participants.
  - "Clickshare" or similar  to easily share and display multiple screens in the main TV.
- Working stations for each participant or subsystem, including:
	- Laptops with [CE and engineering software](/concurrent_engineering#ce_sw) installed.
  - Additional screens per station (if needed).
  - Mouse and power supply cables.
- Supplies (markers, post-its, etc) for the white board.
- Books and literature about the topic of the session (see [bibliography](/bibliography))

## Preparation checklist {#preparation_checklist}
Follow this guideline to prepare the CDF for a new study. Make sure to also check the **[Start Here](/concurrent_engineering#ce_workflow)** page for information on tasks required in preparation for a new study.  

1. Set up the room into its [CDF configuration](#layout)
	Additional desks and chairs can be brought in temporarily from either PPH325 or PPH327. 
  Extra power strips can be found in (?). 
  
1. Request a loan to 'Poseidon' for as many laptops and headsets as needed.
For this go to [support.epfl.ch](https://support.epfl.ch/). 
Log in with your EPFL credentials.
  Then click on 'Request' > 'Information Systems' > 'Computer hardware & software' > 'POSEIDON Request loan equipment' or 'Poseidon Request for events'. 
  Complete the form and submit. Make sure to add any additional details in the 'Comments/specific requests' section (e.g., additional days required for the loan). 
  > Make sure to do this a few weeks ahead of the study. Don't forget to request equipment to be collected at least a day prior to the study so that the room can be set up and the equipment tested before the first session starts.
{.is-warning}

3. Collect equipment, set up stations, and test. 
Make sure all the videoconferencing equipment works as intended. For how to set up each workstation, following this action list:
- Connect the computers to the EPFL wifi with staff credentials (external participants would not have access to it).
- Confirm that all the stations have access to the required [software](/concurrent_engineering#ce_sw).
- On COMET, ...


4. Inform experts about the topic of the study and their role.
Find suitable dates to conduct the sessions with everyone available.
Make sure participants are aware of their roles.
Inform them with a rough planning of the sessions (see [workflow](/concurrent_engineering#ce_workflow)).

5. General logistics (always depending on the number of participants).
Organize an adjacent room for breaks 
> Changing air and socializing with other participants is beneficial for the efficiency of the session.
{.is-success}

(Optional) order food and drinks for the coffen break.
Make sure there is a place/restaurant with enough seats to host everyone if the session lasts the whole day.

## Study closing checklist
1. Set the room in its basic configuration again.
1. Restitute the computers to Poseidon.
Disconnect the computers that used personal wifi credentials.
1. ...
